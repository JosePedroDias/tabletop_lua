## TODO

- serialize items for drawing and manipulation
- move items
- stream changes via noobhub

## Concept ideas:

the board is divided into cardinal-directions per player
(in a 2p game, one sits in N and other is S, etc.)

there are a set of areas that have tags: only i can see, all can see etc.
objects get attributed to each player and sit in their private space (ex their hand)
the player can move their objects and depending where they land, their visibility will be respected according to the area.

enforcing these rules can happen as server logic (events sent by user a get transformed to all listeners)
OR
there can be a silent judge that deals cards, corrects actions etc (this has the downside of players being able to see a state which shouldn't happen, ex player just dropped a card and it's incorrectly visible to all for x time?)

eventually objects have a visibility state from where they are and while the drag happens they remain with it until landing?
